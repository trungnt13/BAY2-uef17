# Two types of variables

The Bayesian interpretation of probability is epistemic, meaning **random variable** _x_‘s probability distribution _p(x)_ represents our knowledge and uncertainty about _x_‘s value.

A **deterministic variable** is defined by a mathematical function that returns its value given values for its parents. Deterministic variables are sometimes called the systemic part of the model. The nomenclature is a bit confusing, because these objects usually represent random variables; since its parents are random, it is random also. A more descriptive (though more awkward) name for this class would be _Determined-By-Values-Of-Parents_.
